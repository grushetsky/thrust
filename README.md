**Chromium-based cross-platform / cross-language application framework**

*Thrust is `require/import`-able, it lets you distribute NodeJS, Go or Python GUI apps directly
through their native package managers.*

Thrust is based on Chromium's Content Module and is supported on Linux, MacOSX and Windows:

*Screenshot of Thrust Getting Started example running on each major platform.*

Thrust will be powering the next versions of [Breach](http://breach.cc).

To better understand what Thrust can do, check out [JankyBrowser](https://gist.github.com/LeoColomb/993506f47fe10e234123) by
@morganrallen (forked by @LeoColomb), the cross-platform browser that fits in a gist:
```
npm install -g https://gist.github.com/LeoColomb/993506f47fe10e234123

## Language bindings

Thrust's binary distribution exposes its API on the standard IO and language
 specific library packages automatically download the binary distribution at
installation. Thrust is based on Chromium's content module and uses web-pages
as its GUI.

All these Getting Started example work as is on each major platform (MacOSX,
Windows, Linux)

### NodeJS

##### Getting Started

First install with `npm install node-thrust`

```Javascript
require('node-thrust')(function(err, api) {
  api.window({ root_url: 'https://breach.cc' }).show();
});
```

##### Library

- **node-thrust** [breach/node-thrust](https://github.com/breach/node-thrust/)

### Go

##### Getting Started

First download with `go get -u github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/`

```Go
package main

import (
	"github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/dispatcher"
	"github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/spawn"
	"github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust/window"
)

func main() {
	spawn.Run()
	thrustWindow := window.NewWindow("http://breach.cc/", nil)
	thrustWindow.Show()
	thrustWindow.Maximize()
	thrustWindow.Focus()
	dispatcher.RunLoop()
}
```

##### Library

- **go-thrust**: [miketheprogrammer/go-thrust](https://github.com/miketheprogrammer/go-thrust)

### Python

##### Getting Started

First install with `pip3 install pythrust [--user]` (requires Python3)

```Python
import asyncio, pythrust

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
api = pythrust.API(loop)

asyncio.async(api.spawn())
asyncio.async(api.window({ 'root_url': 'http://breach.cc' }).show())

loop.run_forever()
```

##### Library

- **pythrust** [breach/pythrust](https://github.com/breach/pythrust/)

### Scala

##### Getting Started

Include scala-thrust jar on your classpath. (Add to lib in your project.)

```Scala
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
import com.github.eklavya.thrust._

object Main extends App {
  Window.create("http://google.com").foreach { w =>
    w.show
    w.maximize
    w.openDevtools
    w.focus(true)
    w.onBlur(() => println("we were blurred"))
    w.onFocus(() => println("we were focused"))
    Menu.create("MyMenu").foreach { m =>
      val i = MenuItem("Item1", _ => println("Item1 was clicked"))
      m.addItem(i)
      m.popup(w)
    }
  }
}
```

##### Library

- **scala-thrust** [eklavya/scala-thrust](https://github.com/eklavya/scala-thrust/)

## Building Thrust from Sources

You will generally don't need to build thrust yourself. A binary version of
thrust should be automatically fetched by the library you're reyling on at
installation.

To build thrust, you'll need to have `python 2.7.x` and `git` installed. You can
then boostrap the project with:
```
./scripts/boostrap.py
```

Build both the `Release` and `Debug` targets with the following commands:
```
./scripts/update.py
./scripts/build.py
```

Note that `bootstrap.py` may take some time as it checks out `brightray` and
downloads `libchromiumcontent` for your platform.
